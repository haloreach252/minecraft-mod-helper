# minecraft-mod-helper
A simple tool i wrote in C# to help me semi-automate the repetitive tasks of making a mod with a lot of blocks and items

If you're using the command line version of the program, follow the prompts to create a new block or item JSON file

If you're using the GUI version of the program, the process is the same, but with buttons instead of commands.
